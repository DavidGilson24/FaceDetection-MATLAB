## Description test

This project utilizes MATLAB's computer vision capabilities to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed. Once a face is identified within the video frame, it is highlighted with a bounding square. As the face moves, the square dynamically adjusts its position to continuously track and encircle the face, ensuring the subject remains within the frame. This project showcases the combination of real-time video processing with face detection algorithms, paving the way for advanced facial recognition technologies.

## Features

- Real-time face detection from webcam feed.
- Dynamic bounding square that tracks and encircles detected faces.
- Efficient face detection algorithms for accurate tracking.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB (Version XX.X or later)
- Computer Vision Toolbox for MATLAB
- A working webcam connected to your computer

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

USE: git clone [repository-link]

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the main script to start the face detection program.

## Usage

1. Ensure your webcam is properly connected and recognized by your computer.
2. Execute the main script in MATLAB.
3. The program will access the webcam and start displaying the video feed.
4. Once a face is detected, it will be highlighted with a bounding square.
