# FaceDetection-MATLAB

# Facial Recognition in MATLAB

This project leverages the power of computer vision to detect faces in real-time using a webcam. When a face is detected within the video frame, the program highlights it with a bounding square. As the face moves, the square dynamically adjusts its position to continuously track and encircle the face, ensuring the subject remains within the frame. This project seamlessly integrates real-time video processing with face detection algorithms, paving the way for advanced facial recognition technologies in our daily lives.

## Setup and Initialization
- Set up your webcam and ensure MATLAB can access it.
- Initialize the video input object for the webcam feed.

## Face Detection Algorithm Selection
- Research and select an appropriate face detection algorithm. The **Viola-Jones face detection method** is a recommended choice.
- Load or train the classifier model based on the chosen algorithm.

## Real-time Video Processing
- Capture a continuous stream of frames from the webcam.
- Convert the frame to grayscale (face detection algorithms typically perform better on grayscale images).
- Apply the face detection algorithm to each frame.

## Bounding Box Creation
- For every detected face in the frame, determine the bounding box's coordinates.
- Draw a square around the detected face using these coordinates.

## Dynamic Tracking
- As the face moves within the frame, update the bounding box's position in real-time.
- Ensure the bounding box adjusts its size and position to keep the face centered.

## Display Output
- Overlay the bounding box on the original video feed.
- Display the processed video feed with the bounding box in a dedicated window.

## Considerations
- **Lighting**: Optimize the algorithm to work efficiently under various lighting conditions.
- **Accessories**: Ensure the algorithm can detect faces even when subjects are wearing items like hats or glasses.
